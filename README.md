# Voting-Machine

Project Overview:

The cosmic ray comes from outer space makes semiconductor store or absence of electrons, and it maybe causes flip bit in transistor.
In the selection system, there are more 4096 votes in a candidate, because the 13th bit of number was filpped in the memory.
It affects the fairness and realness of selection, and people need to spend extra time to recount the votes. 
If left unsolved, people need to spend extra time to check the votes whether is correct.
In this project, it keeps the numbers to be precise. If there is a number changed because of flipping bit, it will change back to be correct. It is importance that keepping selections to be fair.
